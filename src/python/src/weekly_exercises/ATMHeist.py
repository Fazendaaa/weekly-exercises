# Full credit to dramforever for coming up with an O(n) solution to this
# problem!
#
# Beyonce (no relation to Beyoncé) is planning a heist at a local casino. She
# wants steal the money from two ATMs.
#
# While she mostly cares about getting away with money, she's also interested in
# a unique fact about the ATMs at this particular casino; once a day, each ATM
# transfers one dollar to each other machine for each unit of distance away it
# is (e.g. in [0,1] both indices are 1 unit apart).
#
# (Additionally, when emptied, each ATM will automatically refill with the exact
# same dollar amount as before, so it's possible to steal from the same ATM
# twice.)
#
# Because she gets a thrill out of the fact that so much money has been
# transferred between ATMs, what she's ultimately interested in is stealing from
# the two ATMs which have the highest combined total money inside, plus number
# of dollars each transferred to the other.
#
# Your function should return this maximum possible thrill value.
#
# For example, if we have four ATMs: [2, 3, 4, 5], the ATM at index 0 will
# transfer a dollar to index 1, $2 to index 2, and $3 to index 3. Similarly, the
# ATM at index 2 will transfer $1 to indexes 1 and 3, and $2 to index 0.
#
# Note that in the case above, Beyonce will either steal from the last ATM
# (index 3) twice, or steal from index 0 and index 3, because it nets her the
# maximum value of 10 ($5 + $5 + $0 transfer vs. $2 + $5 + $3 transfer). Either
# way, the answer is 10, returned as an integer.
#
# Examples:
#
#   const atms = [3,1,3]
#   maximumThrill(atms) => 8 // $3 + $3 + $2 transferred between each (atms[0] and atms[2])
#
#   const atms = [2,3,4,5]
#   maximumThrill(atms) => 10 // $5 + $5 + $0 transferred (atms[3] and atms[3] again)
#
#   const atms = [10, 10, 11, 13, 7, 8, 9]
#   maximumThrill(atms) => 26 // $10 + $13 + $3 transfer between each (atms[0] and atms[3])
#
#   const atms = [2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 4, 4, 2, 2, 12, 8]
#   maximumThrill(atms) => 34  // $10 + $12 + $12 transfer between each (atms[4] and atms[16])
#
# Note: These are magic ATMs, so don't worry about accounting for whether an ATM
# has enough money to transfer.
#
# Your solution must be O(n) to pass!

def maximumThrill(atms: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the maximum thrill value from a list of ATMs.

    The thrill value is determined by the sum of the values of two ATMs and the distance between them.
    The function iterates through all possible pairs of ATMs to find the maximum thrill value.

    CodeComplexity:
        9

    Args:
        atms (list[int]): A list of integers representing the values of ATMs.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum thrill value calculated from the list of ATMs.

    Example:
        >>> maximumThrill([1, 3, 5])
        9
